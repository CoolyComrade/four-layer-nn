# four-layer-nn
I built a four-layer neural network without using a machine learning framework. This was for educational purposes, so although the program runs rather slowly (~5 minutes for a 50000 epochs), I was able to get some great insight as to how to actually design a neural network. In this repository, I used the MNIST fashion set to train and test my code.
